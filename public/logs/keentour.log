The term &quot;red-light district&quot; was first recorded in the United States in 1894, in an article in The Sentinel, a newspaper in Milwaukee. Other mentions from the 1890s are numerous, and located all over the United States.\n\nThe origin of the &quot;red light&quot; term is considered to be the red lanterns carried by railway workers (which were left outside brothels when the workers entered, so that they could be quickly located for any needed train movement) or the red paper lanterns (which were thought to be sensual) that were hung outside brothels in ancient China to identify them as such. The color red has been associated with prostitution for millennia; in the Biblical story of Rahab, a prostitute in Jericho, aided the spies of Joshua and identified her house with a scarlet rope, which saved her household from the massacre that a successfully besieged city usually suffered. During World War I, there were many brothels in Belgium and France; blue lights were used to indicate brothels for officers, red lights for other ranks.\n\nOne of the many terms used for a red-light district in Japanese is akasen (赤線 ?), literally meaning &quot;red-line&quot;, apparently of independent origins from the English term. Japanese police drew a red line on maps to indicate the boundaries of legal red-light districts. They also have the term aosen (青線 ?), meaning &quot;blue-line&quot;, for a non-legal district. In different cultures red-light districts are identified differently, the most common being &quot;district of prostitutes&quot;\n\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red-light_district\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red-light_district</a>\n\n<a href=\"http://red-light-district-amsterdam.com/\">red-light-district-amsterdam.com/</a>"},"pathalias":"judgedredd76","ownername":"JUDGE DREDD76","datetaken":"2008-06-12 12:53:16","datetakengranularity":"0","dateupload":"1237154734"}],"url":"dmitry-mogilko/amsterdam-red-light--district","userName":"dmitry-mogilko","level":"info","message":"Insert new story","timestamp":"2013-08-22T10:33:26.351Z"}
